# MemoryExperiments
This is all the code needed to analyse the data from the memory experiments. 

## Requirements
You'll need a new version of Julia installed (see [here](https://julialang.org/downloads/) for instructions on how to install Julia).

## How to use
1. Download this repository.
2. Start a new Julia REPL (e.g. by double-clicking the Julia icon) inside the downloaded folder (or navigate there from an open Julia session).
3. Simply run the `main.jl`-file with:
   ```julia
   include("main.jl")
   ```
4. All the figures in the article have been generated in the `figures` folder, and the statistics are saved to the `stats.csv` file.
